/*20.Write a program to create the equivalent of a four-function calculator.
The program to enter two integerâ€™s numbers and an operator. It then carries
out the specified arithmetic operator
operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of the
two numbers. Finally, it displays the result.
